          <div id="jsi" class="hidden"> JSI cabinetry was founded in 1997. We started out with humble beginnings, carrying an oak kitchen line with matching vanities in a 5,500 square foot warehouse that had dirt floors and multiple leaks in the roof. With tarps and hard work, our dreams of becoming a national distributor of cabinetry began to grow roots.

           By the year 2001 business had justified a move to a 30,000 square foot warehouse. JSI – at that time with 8 employees and a single sales rep – had 2 kitchen lines and 4 vanity lines.

           In 2006 a further expansion was required and construction of a new 81,250 square foot facility began and was completed before the end of that year.

           A year later an addition was needed, making the total square footage of the Fall River, MA building 125,000.

           Since then we have strategically added distribution centers in Atlanta, Chicago, and Denver. We currently offer over 20 styles of kitchen cabinetry and employ over 100 people.

           We are manufacturers/distributors of quality all-wood (no particleboard) kitchen and bath cabinetry. You have the ability to choose from a large assortment of styles and colors including stains, paints, glazes, regular or full overlay, even inset. All in stock and ready for immediate delivery.

 JSI’s mission statement is: “To provide affordable fashion for today’s home”
 Everything we do is driven by this simple, but powerful statement.

           You’ve fallen in love with the designer cabinets in magazines, wishing you could have a kitchen or bath that looks just like them. But you’re also aware of real world budget limitations. Is there any way your wish can become reality?

           That’s where JSI steps in. Imagine a company that offers the designs found in custom cabinetry at a price to fit your budget, without skimping on quality and design. It’s a wish come true!

           JSI offers rich details, attractive finishes, quality all-wood construction and an assortment of cabinets to fit your home and your lifestyle.

           We are proud to provide affordable alternatives to today’s over-priced styles. We do it by sticking to the basics – products that are functional and efficient – that stand the test of time, both in workmanship and design.

           JSI cabinets and related accessories are the perfect choice for the discerning homeowner, adding value to your home for years to come.
