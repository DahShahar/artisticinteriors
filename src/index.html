          <div id="jsi" class="hidden"> JSI cabinetry was founded in 1997. We started out with humble beginnings, carrying an oak kitchen line with matching vanities in a 5,500 square foot warehouse that had dirt floors and multiple leaks in the roof. With tarps and hard work, our dreams of becoming a national distributor of cabinetry began to grow roots.

           By the year 2001 business had justified a move to a 30,000 square foot warehouse. JSI – at that time with 8 employees and a single sales rep – had 2 kitchen lines and 4 vanity lines.

           In 2006 a further expansion was required and construction of a new 81,250 square foot facility began and was completed before the end of that year.

           A year later an addition was needed, making the total square footage of the Fall River, MA building 125,000.

           Since then we have strategically added distribution centers in Atlanta, Chicago, and Denver. We currently offer over 20 styles of kitchen cabinetry and employ over 100 people.

           We are manufacturers/distributors of quality all-wood (no particleboard) kitchen and bath cabinetry. You have the ability to choose from a large assortment of styles and colors including stains, paints, glazes, regular or full overlay, even inset. All in stock and ready for immediate delivery.

 JSI’s mission statement is: “To provide affordable fashion for today’s home”
 Everything we do is driven by this simple, but powerful statement.

           You’ve fallen in love with the designer cabinets in magazines, wishing you could have a kitchen or bath that looks just like them. But you’re also aware of real world budget limitations. Is there any way your wish can become reality?

           That’s where JSI steps in. Imagine a company that offers the designs found in custom cabinetry at a price to fit your budget, without skimping on quality and design. It’s a wish come true!

           JSI offers rich details, attractive finishes, quality all-wood construction and an assortment of cabinets to fit your home and your lifestyle.

           We are proud to provide affordable alternatives to today’s over-priced styles. We do it by sticking to the basics – products that are functional and efficient – that stand the test of time, both in workmanship and design.

           JSI cabinets and related accessories are the perfect choice for the discerning homeowner, adding value to your home for years to come.

          <h3>Stone</h3>
          <p class="blurb last_partner"><b>Granite</b>
        Granite is a purely natural stone that comes directly from stone quarries and is then cut into thin slabs, polished, and fabricated into countertops.

        <b>Quartzite</b>
        Quartzite is typically made of more than 90% quartzite; some can get as high as 99%. Quartzite has a glassy appearance and resembles marble in some cases. This generally desirable appearance has made quartzite one of the most popular countertop materials.

        <b>Marble</b>
        Marble is a type of metamorphic rock that is known for its beauty and high price, but still some choose to use it as countertop material in a kitchen.

        <b>Soapstone</b>
        Soapstone is a natural stone, like granite, that is quarried. It's composed mostly of mineral talc, which makes it quite soft, but soapstone used for countertops typically has higher percentages of quartz in it, which makes it harder and more suitable as a kitchen surface.

          <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
          <h4>Wood Butcher Block</h4>
          <p class="blurb"> Warm and accommodating, butcher block is an affordable countertop material with a lot going for it. Maintain them regularly and butcher block countertops will reward you by aging gracefully. But without proper upkeep, they can dull and crack.

          <b>What is butcher block?</b>
          Butcher block is made from straight cuts of wood glued together into thick slabs that provide a particularly sturdy and stable work surface in a kitchen, whether as a cutting board, tabletop, or counter.
          There are three basic construction styles of butcher block: edge grain, face grain, and end grain.

          <b>Edge Grain</b>
          Edge grain is the one most commonly used for counters because it’s strong, stable, and less expensive than the others. It’s made by placing long boards on their sides and joining them so that their long narrow edges form the surface. The boards can be continuous lengths of wood with no joints, or random-length boards that are finger-jointed.

          <b>Face Grain</b>
          Face-grain butcher block is constructed from boards that are laid flat, their full widths forming a surface with a streamlined look. Susceptible to marks when used for chopping and cutting, face grain is less suitable for working kitchen counters than the others.

          <b>End Grain</b>
          End-grain construction is made from small rectangular blocks arranged so that the ends (with growth rings showing) are visible on the surface. The strongest and most expensive type of butcher block, it’s great for surfaces dedicated to cutting, because it camouflages knife marks and is gentle on blade edges (they slide into the grain rather then against it).
          </p>

          <h4>Glass</h4>
          <p class="blurb"> Beautiful glass kitchen countertops and raised bars.
          Both functional and reflective of your taste, the kitchen is the heart of every home. The translucent and luminous appearance of glass will bring a unique character to your kitchen countertop, raised bar or island and will transform your eating area.
          If you’re looking for something different and attractive for your countertop or kitchen island, our exclusive technology and hand-manufacturing process give each piece of glass a unique
          appearance. No one will have a kitchen quite like yours!
          </p>

          <h4>Metal</h4>
          <p class="blurb"> Unlike stone (such as the ubiquitous granite) metal is nonporous (read antibacterial and stain-resistant). In the case of copper and zinc, they're recyclable, and metal countertops don't require sealing or more than soap and water to clean... Except for stainless steel, the metals will also oxidize, forming a patina.
